Welcome to 2021
===============

Another new year, another new version of my blog running on another new platform.
This year, I am giving [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a run via an Azure StaticApp.

It does mean I finally need to learn how to write properly in markdown.

The workflow is pretty straight forward though.

1. Update the post and commit the changes
2. Push the commit to my Github repo
3. Wait for the trigger action to build the site and upload it to Azure
4. Profit.

So far, so good.
